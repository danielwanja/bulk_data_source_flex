This document contains several design decisions or thoughts I'll make along the way:

5/19/2011 
- Using ArrayCollection instead of Vector. 
- Using dynamic class so we don't have to repeat Rails column_names in Flex.
  Implications are that we'll need metadata to correctly transform date fields
  and associations. We also don't want to send non-attribute fields back to the 
  server. First version will have a metadata.json file that describes
  all attributes/type and associations. Subsequently that could also include validations
  to support client side validations. I'll hand code this metadata.json file in a first
  version but that could be generated dynamically from Rails (gem/rake/...).  
- using Ruby style attribute names with underscore .i.e. first_name
